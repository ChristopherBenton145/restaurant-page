# Restaurant Page

This is a really good looking website I built.

## Getting Started

-View it online
Vist the website `https://restaurant-page42.netlify.app`.

-Get it running yourself

1. First you want to install the dependencies so run `npm install` in the project directory.
2. Once you have all of the dependencies, run `npm run start` in the project directory.
